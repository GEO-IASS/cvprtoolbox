Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition toolbox

PURPOSE
 The aim of this toolbox is to present source codes in matlab 
 as another kind of references for helping people to understand 
 computer vision methods. Thus, some methods were re-implemented,
 even if matlab has the methods originally, when their source 
 codes are not available. For example, kmeans algorithm 
 was re-implemented. 
 Howerver, notice that the built-in functions are faster than
 functions created in this toolbox because the built-in functions 
 are mostly written in C. 

FIRST THING TO DO
 >> run '<path to cvprtoolbox>/startup.m'
 >> help cvprtoolbox

RUN DEMO
 Demos are assumed to be ran at 'demo' directory. 
 >> cd '<path to cvprtoolbox>/demo'
 You can find examples about how to run functions at there. 
 (they are like examples rather than tutorials)

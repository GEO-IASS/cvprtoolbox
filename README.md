Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition toolbox

**NEWS: This library is not maintained anymore. New maintainers are welcome!**

# PURPOSE

The aim of this toolbox is to present source codes in matlab 
as another kind of references for helping people to understand 
computer vision methods. Thus, some methods were re-implemented,
even if matlab has the methods originally, when their source 
codes are not available. For example, kmeans algorithm 
was re-implemented. 
Howerver, notice that the built-in functions are faster than
functions created in this toolbox because the built-in functions 
are mostly written in C. 

# FIRST THING TO DO

```
>> run '<path to cvprtoolbox>/startup.m'
>> help cvprtoolbox
```

# RUN DEMO

Demos are assumed to be ran at 'demo' directory. 

```
>> cd '<path to cvprtoolbox>/demo'
```

You can find examples about how to run functions at there. 
(they are like examples rather than tutorials)
